Text_Of_Pisciculture = Fish farming, also known as aquaculture is an activity focused on the cultivation of aquatic organisms both in coastal and inland<br> areas, which involves interventions in the breeding process to increase their production. The conditions to choose what kind of<br> species to grow are determined by the climate and the advantages that they can produce, such as being easy to transport and<br> handle, that withstand external conditions, that grow rapidly and tolerate high planting densities, including polyculture , which is to<br> grow two or more species in the same pond in order to make better use of space and food. <br><br>In Colombia, this economic activity focuses on the cultivation of two species: tilapia and trout. Both species can be seasoned,<br> which means that production can be guaranteed throughout the year. Fish farming is considered one of the most important<br> economic activities and the ones with the greatest development and growth, since 50% of the world's fish consumption comes<br> from farmed fish.
